# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

# Plan A

## Purpose
This repository contains code for a medication-switching tool created as a **proof of concept** for a hackathon. It was developed solely to demonstrate programming skills and explore the use of technology in a conceptual setting.

**The logic implemented is entirely fictional and does not reflect any medical guidelines or evidence-based practices.** The primary purpose of this tool is to showcase programming capabilities, not to provide clinical solutions.
